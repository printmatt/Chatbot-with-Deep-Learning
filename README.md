# Chatbot-with-Deep-Learning
This is a Chatbot that is trained using the seq2seq model. It goes through deep learning in a recurrent neural network, specifically LSTM cells. It's amazingly powerful and can be further incorporated in other application with modifications.

Technologies Used:
  @ Tensorflow version 1.0
  @ Spyder
  @ Virtual Environment in Anaconda
  
Model is still under training and will be updated soon.
