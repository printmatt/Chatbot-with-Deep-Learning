# Chatbot-with-Deep-Learning
This is a Chatbot that is trained using the seq2seq model. It goes through deep learning in a recurrent neural network, specifically LSTM cells. It's amazingly powerful and can be further incorporated in other application with modifications.

Technologies Used:
  @ Python 3.5.5
  @ Tensorflow version 1.0
  @ Spyder IDE
  @ Virtual Environment created in Anaconda
    
Model is still under training and will be updated soon.
